 ### Plugin Development
 
 This project is now Gradle based and is much easier to get the development 
 environment setup to work on the plugin. You should only need to import the 
 project in either Intellij Community or Intellij Ultimate and execute the runIde
 Gradle task. For more information please see the official Jetbrains plugin
 development documentation.
